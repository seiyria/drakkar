Weapon specializations are essentially a skill boost in one particular skill. You can think of it as a +1 on top of your existing skill. Fighter/Paladin/Barbarian get 3 specializations, and Thief gets 1.

You can choose to either spec 3 times for the same weapon, or for 3 different weapons.

If you choose to specialize multiple times in different weapons, you can do it at level 15, level 17, and level 19. If you choose to do 3 of the same weapons, you can specialize at level 15, level 19, and level 24. 

To specialize, you go to a trainer, hold a weapon from the particular weapon class (say, longsword) and you'll say `xxx, specialize longsword`. Halberds are considered "polearm" for specialization purposes.

Specializations can be removed by going to an NPC in the Conqueror's Club and giving up a Lanapi staff (warning: you will LOSE access to this area and have to regain it by fetching the 9 items).
