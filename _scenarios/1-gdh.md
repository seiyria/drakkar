{% include base_path %}

Green Dragon Hatcheries (GDH) is considered an extension to [Nameless Lands]({{ base_path }}/scenarios/nl/), thus sharing the same "alts" with it. You can enter by going to Acrona and saying `acr, go` when you're level 40. You can also enter from Jilian, if you are subscribed to Upper Guild Hall, using `jil, gdh`.

The content starts at about level 40, but realistically you'll want to be level 60-70+ to make any meaningful progress. GDH is split into 2 parts, commonly referred to as GDH1 and GDH2. You need to do progress quests to get from one to the next.
