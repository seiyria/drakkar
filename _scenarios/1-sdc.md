{% include base_path %}

Silver Dragon Consort (SDC) is considered an extension to [Nameless Lands]({{ base_path }}/scenarios/nl), thus sharing the same "alts" with it. You can enter by going to the southeast of GDH2 and talking to the Arbiter when you're level 40, but you'll want to be level 70+ before you do anything here. You can also enter from Jilian, if you are subscribed to Upper Guild Hall, using `jil, sdc`.

SDC is where you'll do most of your leveling from 74ish to 85ish. You'll also be able to progress a bunch of primal quirks here, such as Air Head, Cavern Creeper, and Tree Hugger.
